# Advent of Code 2021 solutions

## Introduction
This repository contains C# solutions for [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021) puzzles. Each puzzle day sources is in its own Project within a Visual Studio solution.

### License
**GNU GPLv3**. See `LICENSE` in root directory.

## Usage
Sources are probably best to be executed within Visual Studio by opening the whole repository as a solution. Afterwards, you are required to include your own AoC example/input files and link them to the project or you can edit the source code directly and use your own preferred way of reading the input file(s).

Executing any `Program.cs` will return a value needed to solve the puzzle/part for the related day.

#### Limitations
Some first part solutions are working well within their range (first part of daily puzzle), but may not be efficient enough in the second part of the puzzle due to huge memory requirements/process time.
